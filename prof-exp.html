									<h4>EdSHARe at Population Research Center, The University of Texas at Austin</h4>
									<p>As the Director of Research Operations for the Education Studies in Healthy Aging Research (EdSHARe), I have been pivotal in coordinating and managing a large, multidisciplinary team across multiple institutions, including the University of Texas at Austin, University of Minnesota, University of Wisconsin–Madison, and Columbia University. My work involves designing and implementing multimode surveys to assess educational, occupational, health, and life outcomes for nationally representative samples. My expertise in managing complex, interdisciplinary research studies extends to overseeing budgets, allocating resources, monitoring timelines, and coordinating data collection and analysis efforts. I am also actively involved in securing funding, fostering partnerships with other large longitudinal cohort studies, and disseminating study data to promote broader understanding and application.</p>

									<h4>Texas Behavioral Science and Policy Institute (TxBSPI) at Population Research Center, The University of Texas at Austin</h4>
									<p>In my role as Chief Operating Officer and Scientific Director at TxBSPI, I led the institute’s strategic planning, thought leadership, and organizational restructuring to address social and behavioral science research focused on inequality. I managed multiple large-scale research projects, developed partnerships with universities, foundations, and government funders, and coordinated efforts to scale innovative research practices. My notable projects included the National Study of Learning Mindsets, which examined the impact of learning mindset interventions on student achievement, and the Texas Mindset Initiative, which analyzed classroom practices through a learning mindset lens.</p>

									<h4>Institute for Public School Initiatives, The University of Texas at Austin</h4>
									<p>I served as a Research Associate and Graduate Research Assistant, where I designed and executed data collection plans, employed rigorous quantitative methods for outcomes evaluations, and created and maintained large, multi-year databases. My work supported various state agencies and school districts by providing data-driven insights and evaluation reports.</p>

									<h4>Public Policy Research Institute, Texas A&M University</h4>
									<p>My research contributions are widely recognized, with multiple publications in top-tier journals that focus on educational psychology, public policy, and urban studies. Notable works include his co-authorship of studies on growth mindset interventions in educational settings, longitudinal evidence on the impacts of teacher mindsets on student outcomes, and the examination of social-cognitive changes related to educational interventions.</p>
